# Disjunctive Memory

## Overview

### Disjunctiveness

A disjunctive sequence over an alphabet _A_ is an infinite sequence, the finite subsequences of which include every finite combination of elements of _A_.

### The Idea

Given an arbitrary finite datum _d_ and an arbitrary disjunctive sequence _S_, there exists some nonnegative integer _n_ such that _S_[_n_,_n_+len(_d_)] = _d_.
