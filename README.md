# Disjunctive Memory

#### A system for small-size storage of big-size data

## Overview

Disjunctive Memory (D.M.) relies stores data using disjunctive numbers, id est irrational numbers whose digital expansions contain each possible finite subsequence. Given an arbitrary finite sequence of digits _d_ (data) and an arbitrary disjunctive number _x_, there exists a nonnegative integer _n_ such that the _n+m_-th digit of _x_ is identical to the _m_-th digit of _d_, for _m_ < len(d).
