# Disjunctive Memory

## Overview

### Disjunctiveness

A disjunctive sequence over an alphabet _A_ is an infinite sequence, the finite subsequences of which include every finite combination of elements of _A_.

An irrational number is disjunctive in base _b_ if its decimal expansion is a disjunctive sequence over the alphabet {0,1,...,_b_-1}.
